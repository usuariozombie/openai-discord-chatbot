# openai-discord-chatbot
This is a Discord bot that uses the OpenAI API to answer questions. When a user sends a question to the bot, it uses OpenAI's natural language processing model to generate a response. Additionally, the bot also stores the conversation in a SQLite database so the bot can access the message history and the conversation is fluent.
